        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Rate Page in the Django Invoice application is a key interface used to calculate and manage rates for various orders.
                It allows users to input different rates, calculate totals for orders, and view previously submitted bills.
                This page dynamically interacts with order data and handles the final billing process, including aggregation of quantities and amounts based on the user's input.
            </p>
        </section>



        <section>
            <h2>Process Flow</h2>
            <h3>Order Retrieval</h3>
            <p>
                The rate page fetches relevant orders based on a comma-separated list of Order IDs (csoid) stored in the TempRate table.
                This allows aggregation of data for multiple orders at once. Orders are retrieved using Django's ORM and aggregated
                to calculate the total quantity (aggregated_quantity) and amount (aggregated_amount).
            </p>

            <h3>Rate Calculation and Display</h3>
            <p>
                Once the user inputs the rates, the JavaScript function calculates the transport rate and final amount.
                These values are displayed on the page and are also stored in hidden fields for submission to the server.
            </p>

            <h3>Form Submission</h3>
            <p>
                After calculating the final rates, the form is submitted to the server to update the order amounts
                and store the billing information in the Billing table. Each order is updated with the calculated final amount,
                ensuring consistency across the records.
            </p>

            <h3>Billing Storage</h3>
            <p>
                During form submission, if a billing record already exists for a particular order (oid),
                the existing record is deleted, and a new record is created in the Billing table. This ensures that updated rates
                are applied consistently across orders.
            </p>
            <p>The billing information is then available for display in the Previous Bill Information section.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>Key Functionalities</h2>
            <h3>Display of Order Details</h3>
            <p>
                The Rate Page shows a table with the following details for each order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Order ID (oid):</strong> Unique identifier for each order.</li>
                <li><strong>Supplier Name (fname):</strong> The name of the supplier.</li>
                <li><strong>Place (Pname):</strong> Location associated with the order.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Name (product):</strong> The name of the product for which the order is placed.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantity (pcs):</strong> The number of units ordered.</li>
                <li><strong>Date Field 3 (df3):</strong> The date associated with each order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This table helps users verify and understand the details of the orders before proceeding with rate calculations.</p>

            <h3>Rate Calculation Form</h3>
            <p>A form is provided where users can input the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Rate:</strong> The overall rate for the order.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Rate:</strong> The rate associated with the material only.</li>
                <li><strong>Bill Date:</strong> The date for generating the final bill.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These fields are required to proceed with the rate calculation.</p>

            <h3>Amount Calculation</h3>
            <p>
                Once the user inputs the rates, the <strong>Calculate</strong> button triggers a JavaScript function
                <code>calculateAmount(event)</code> that calculates two critical values:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transport Rate:</strong> The difference between the total rate and the material rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Amount:</strong> This is the total quantity of the order multiplied by the total rate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These calculated values are displayed in the Additional Rate Information section, including the transport rate and the final amount.
                The system also stores these values in hidden input fields for later submission.
            </p>

            <h3>Submission of Final Rates</h3>
            <p>After the calculation, the user can submit the calculated values by pressing the <strong>Submit</strong> button. The form is sent via POST to store the final billing information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Final Rate:</strong> The total rate applied.</li>
                <li><strong>Material Rate:</strong> The rate specific to the material.</li>
                <li><strong>Transport Rate:</strong> The derived rate from subtracting the material rate from the total rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Amount:</strong> The calculated total amount based on the quantity and total rate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Previous Bill Information</h3>
            <p>
                Below the rate calculation form, there is a section that displays previous bills for the same customer, product, and place combination. This section includes the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bill ID</li>
                <li>Customer Name</li>
                <li>Bill Date</li>
                <li>Final Rate</li>
                <li>Material Rate</li>
                <li>Transport Rate</li>
                <li>Final Amount</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If no previous bills are available for the selected combination, a message is displayed stating "No previous bills found for this customer, place, and product."</p>
